# Inbound-Cleaner
Invalid Inbound trade and auto trade calculation.

Inbound Trade Cleaner checks all inbound trades for invalid ones meaning it declines all inbound trades where you or your trade partner no longer has the items needed for the trade. It will also auto-calculate all leftover valid trades based on current rolimons values for any wins/ties with the option to decline all losing trades.
